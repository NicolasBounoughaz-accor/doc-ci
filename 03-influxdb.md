# InfluxDB

InfluxDB is an open-source time series database (TSDB) developed by InfluxData. It is written in Go and optimized for fast, high-availability storage and retrieval of time series data in fields such as operations monitoring, application metrics, etc.

Accor CI/CD use it to store DevOPS KPI measurements like code coverage, checkstyle warnings, etc and system metrics for system monitoring.

## 1. Architecture

![Apps CI-Accor](/assets/tick.jpg "CI/CD data architecture")

Telgraf is an agent, it collects system metrics like memory usage, and send it to InfluxDB for storing them.

Grafana is the GUI for analysis and datav visualization.

[KPI-CLI](04-kpi-cli.md) is an ETL, it collects data on Jenkins API and application performance, in order to
monitor the application KPI.

### 1.2 Services

The different services are hosted on `db.ci-accor.io` and the docker-compose file path is `/datadrive/app/influxdb/stack/docker-compose.yml`

#### 1.2.1 InfluxDB

To push data intInfluxDB use the TCP/8086 port on `db.ci-accor.io`. 

Databases :

```bash
> show databases
name: databases
name
----
_internal
test
telegraf
kpi
```

##### 1.2.1.1 KPI database

Database `kpi` is used to store application KPI. Data are extracted by KPI-CLI ETL. A measurement is like a SQL table with a timestamp field.

```sql
> show measurements on kpi
name: measurements
name
----
app_size
build_result
checkstyle
cobertura_data
coverage
duplicate
jenkins_data
sloc
unit_test
```

`kpi` database is used to store application KPI and data are extracted by the KPI-CLI ETL.

##### 1.2.1.2 Telegraf database

`telegraf` database is powered by the different Telegraf agent running on every node. It contains the system and application lmetrics 

```bash
> show measurements on telegraf
name: measurements
name
----
cpu
disk
diskio
docker
docker_container_blkio
docker_container_cpu
docker_container_mem
docker_container_net

#### 1.2.2 Chronograf

Chronograf is the InfluxDataâ€™s open source web application. Chronograf is used with the other components of the TICK (Telegraf, InfluxDB, Chronograf, Kapacitor) stack to visualize monitoring data and create alerting and automation rules :

https://db.ci-accor.io/chronograf

Accor CI/CD use it to monitor the differents virtual machines and their services.

#### 1.2.3 Grafana

#### 1.2.4 Telegraf

Telegraf is an agent which runs on every CI/CD machine. It collects metrics about application and system to monitor the services.

# 2. Networking

Traefik is used as a reverse proxy in front of Docker engine :

## 3. Administration

On `db.ci-accor.io` as `accor-admin` user.
